## Hotel User Interface



# Non-Functional
- Security: Keep guests personal information secure (Credit Cards, Room #, etcâ€¦). Only certain departments should have access to certain information.
- Usability: Should be able to be used by both mobile and non-mobile devices. Not every staffed position has access to a desk. All specific department information must be accessible
- Reliability: The system cohesive and functional with minimal issues on the user end.
